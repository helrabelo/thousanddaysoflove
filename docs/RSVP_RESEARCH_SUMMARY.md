# RSVP UX Research - Executive Summary
## Thousand Days of Love Wedding Website

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Project:** thousandaysof.love
**Current Status:** Functional RSVP, needs emotional enhancement
**Goal:** Match VideoHeroSection's elegance and create memorable experience

---

## The Problem

Your wedding website has a **stunning VideoHeroSection**—immersive video, elegant animations, audio toggle, sophisticated design language. Guests experience "WOW!"

Then they click to RSVP and get a **functional form**—search box, guest list, basic modal. The experience drops from "WOW!" to "meh."

**The disconnect:** Your RSVP treats confirmation as data collection, not celebration.

---

## The Opportunity

Modern luxury wedding RSVPs (2024-2025) are **emotional experiences**, not administrative tasks. The best platforms:
- Tell the couple's story BEFORE asking for confirmation
- Use photos/videos to create emotional connection
- Celebrate the "YES!" moment with delight
- Guide guests to next steps seamlessly
- Work beautifully on mobile (70-85% of traffic)

**Your 1000-day milestone is PERFECT for this transformation.**

The RSVP enhancement isn't about adding features—it's about **extending that emotional excellence** to the entire guest journey.

**3 small additions (confetti, story, countdown) = transformative impact.**

The research shows this pattern works. The code is ready. The design system supports it. The timeline is achievable.

Time to transform "Will you come to our wedding?" into "We can't wait to celebrate 1000 days becoming forever—and we want YOU there!" 🎉
