# Sanity CMS Restructure - Executive Summary

## The Problem

Content editors (Hel & Ylana) are confused about where to manage their relationship story content:

- "Story Cards" lives under "Conteúdo" section
- "Nossa História (Timeline)" lives under "Páginas" section
- No clear relationship between them
- To show same story on homepage AND timeline = must duplicate content in 2 places
- Editing requires updating both locations (risk of inconsistency)

**Pain Point**: "Where do I add our engagement story? Story Cards? Timeline? Both?"

---

## The Solution

Unified content architecture with clear organization:

### NEW Structure
```
📄 Páginas > 📖 Nossa História
├─ ⚙️ Configurar Página     ← Timeline page settings
├─ 📚 Fases da História      ← Timeline phases (groups)
└─ ❤️ Momentos da História   ← Individual story moments
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Create moment once
   - Toggle where it appears (homepage/timeline/both)
   - Edit once, updates everywhere

2. **Clear Organization**
   - All story content grouped under "Nossa História"
   - Intuitive hierarchy: Page → Phases → Moments
   - Visual badges show usage: "📍 Homepage + Timeline"

3. **Enhanced Schema**
   - Better fields (date type, video support, phase relationships)
   - Visibility controls (independent homepage/timeline toggles)
   - Timeline layout options (left/right alignment)

---

## Benefits

### For Content Editors
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Add story to 2 places | Add once, choose where it appears |
| Edit in 2 places | Edit once, updates everywhere |
| Confusing organization | Clear hierarchy |
| No visibility indicators | Preview badges show usage |
| Manual phase organization | Auto-phase assignment |

**Time Savings**: ~70% reduction in content management time

### For Developers
- Single content model (no duplication)
- Reusable references (not inline objects)
- Better queries (proper date types, relationships)
- Cleaner architecture

### For Users (Wedding Guests)
- Consistent stories across site
- Richer content (videos, better layouts)
- Better organized timeline

---

## Implementation Overview

### What Changes

**Schemas**:
- Rename: `storyCard` → `storyMoment` (with enhancements)
- New: `storyPhase` (timeline phases)
- Update: `timelinePage` (use references, not inline events)
- Update: `storyPreview` (rename field references)

**Studio Sidebar**:
- Move: "Story Cards" from "Conteúdo" → "Páginas > Nossa História"
- Add: Phase management interface
- Add: Preview badges for visibility

**Frontend**:
- Update: GROQ queries
- Update: Component types
- Update: Timeline rendering

### What Stays the Same

- All existing content preserved (migrated, not deleted)
- Same visual design on frontend
- Same user experience for guests
- No breaking changes for guests

---

## Migration Strategy

### Automated Migration
```typescript
1. Create 3 default phases:
   - "Os Primeiros Dias" (Dia 1-100)
   - "Construindo Juntos" (Dia 101-500)
   - "Rumo ao Altar" (Dia 501-1000)

2. Convert storyCard → storyMoment:
   - Copy all fields
   - Assign phase based on day number
   - Enable both homepage + timeline visibility
   - Convert date strings to date types

3. Update references:
   - Homepage storyPreview → new moments
   - Timeline page → phase/moment references
```

**Data Safety**:
- Full dataset backup before migration
- Rollback script available
- No data loss (migration preserves everything)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | High | Full backup, dry run, rollback plan |
| Broken frontend after schema change | Medium | Comprehensive testing, staged rollout |
| Content editor confusion | Low | User guide, training session |
| Performance degradation | Low | Query optimization, testing |

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:
1. Revert Git commit
2. Restore Sanity dataset from backup
3. Redeploy Studio
4. Notify users

**Rollback Time**: 15-30 minutes

## Timeline & Effort

### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Tasks | Time | Owner |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| 1. Schema Creation | Create/update 4 schemas | 2h | Dev |
| 2. Desk Structure | Reorganize sidebar | 1h | Dev |
| 3. Data Migration | Run migration script | 1h | Dev |
| 4. Frontend Updates | Update queries/components | 2h | Dev |
| 5. Testing | Comprehensive testing | 1h | Dev |
| 6. Documentation | Update docs | 1h | Dev |
| 7. User Training | Walk-through with editors | 1h | Dev + Hel/Ylana |

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours (1-2 days)

### Recommended Schedule
