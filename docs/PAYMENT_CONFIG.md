# Payment Configuration

## Minimum Payment Amount Feature Flag

The minimum payment amount can be configured via environment variable to support different testing and production scenarios.

### Environment Variable

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=50
```

### Usage

#### Production Environment (Default)
```bash
# .env.production or .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=50
```
- Enforces R$50 minimum for all payments
- Recommended for production to avoid small test payments

#### Testing Environment
```bash
# .env.local (for local testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=1
```
- Allows R$1 minimum payments
- Perfect for testing Mercado Pago integration without spending R$50 each time

### How It Works

The configuration is centralized in `src/lib/config/payments.ts`:

```typescript
export const MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT = parseInt(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT || '50',
  10
)
```

This value is used across:
- ‚úÖ **PaymentModal** - Frontend validation and UI
- ‚úÖ **Credit Card Form** - Payment validation
- ‚úÖ **Input fields** - HTML min attribute
- ‚úÖ **Error messages** - Dynamic minimum amount text

### Quick Switch Guide

**To test with R$1 payments:**
1. Add to your `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=1`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Create a R$1 test gift in Sanity Studio
4. Test payment flow with minimal cost

**To switch back to production:**
1. Change to: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=50`
2. Restart server
3. Or remove the variable entirely (defaults to 50)

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Safety**: The default is 50, so if you forget to set the env var in production, it will use the safer R$50 minimum.

üí° **Sanity CMS**: Gift prices can be as low as R$1 regardless of this setting. The frontend will enforce the minimum at payment time.

üîÑ **Server Restart Required**: Changes to `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables require a server restart to take effect.
