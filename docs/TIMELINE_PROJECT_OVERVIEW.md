## Project Vision

Transform the static wedding timeline from a **passive schedule display** into an **interactive, real-time celebration platform** that:

- Shows guests what's happening NOW based on actual time
- Updates automatically every 30 seconds
- Displays on TV at venue + guest mobile devices
- Enables photo uploads tied to specific timeline events
- Reduces confusion and increases engagement
- Creates anticipation for upcoming moments
- Celebrates completed moments with guest photos

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State**:
- Static timeline hardcoded in EventTimeline component
- 5 events from 10:45 to 14:00 (fixed times)
- No awareness of current time or event status
- No guest interaction or photo integration
- Same view for all guests regardless of when they arrive

**Guest Pain Points**:
1. Early arrivals don't know how long until ceremony starts
2. Guests miss key moments because they don't know schedule
3. Photo opportunities lost (no prompts to capture moments)
4. Between-event confusion ("What's next?")
5. Remote viewers feel disconnected

---

## Solution Overview

### Three-Tier Approach

**Tier 1: Sanity CMS Event Management** ✅
- Create `weddingTimelineEvent` schema
- Admin manages events via Sanity Studio (no code changes needed)
- Events include: title, time, duration, icon, location, photo upload settings

**Tier 2: Real-Time State Calculation** ✅
- Service layer calculates current event based on actual time
- Auto-updates every 30 seconds
- Handles edge cases (before first event, between events, after last event)
- Shows relative time ("em 15 minutos") not just absolute ("11:30")

**Tier 3: Multi-Device Display** ✅
- **TV Display**: Large-screen optimized (Concept 1 "Theater Marquee")
- **Mobile**: Scrollable timeline (Concept 2 "Progress Journey")
- **Sync Option**: QR code connection (Concept 3 "Split Screen Cinema")

---

## Design Concepts Summary

### Concept 1: "Theater Marquee" (TV Display)

**Best For**: Large screen at venue (55-65 inches)

**Layout**:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│   Current Event (50% screen)   │ ← Dominant
├────────────────────────────────┤

├────────────────────────────────┤
│   Completed Events (25%)       │ ← Celebration
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features**:
- Readable from 15 feet away
- 72px wedding title, 64px event titles

### Concept 2: "Progress Journey" (Mobile)

**Best For**: Guest mobile devices (portrait orientation)

**Layout**:
```
┌────────────────┐
│ Sticky Header  │ ← "Você está aqui"
├────────────────┤
│ Progress Bar   │ ← 60% complete
├────────────────┤

TV Display:
┌──────────┬──────────────┬──────────┐
│  Next    │   Current    │  Photos  │
│  Events  │   (50%)      │  Gallery │
└──────────┴──────────────┴──────────┘

Mobile:
┌────────────────┐
│  QR Code Scan  │ → Sync with TV
├────────────────┤
│  Current Event │
├────────────────┤
│  Upload Photo  │ → Appears on TV
└────────────────┘
```

**Key Features**:
- QR code on TV screen
- Mobile connects via WebSocket
- Actions on mobile appear on TV (after moderation)
- Live photo gallery carousel
- Social presence counter ("42 phones connected")

**Implementation**: 4 days (sync complexity)

---

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Sanity CMS (Content)
       ↓
  GROQ Query (fetch events)
       ↓
LiveTimelineService (calculate state)
       ↓
  React Components (render)
       ↓
Auto-Update Loop (every 30s)
```

### Database Schema

**Sanity CMS** (Content Management):
- `weddingTimelineEvent` document type
- Fields: title, startTime, endTime, icon, location, allowPhotoUploads, etc.

**Supabase** (Transactional Data):
- `guest_photos` table: Add `timeline_event_id` column
- `timeline_views` table: Track guest engagement
- RLS policies for security

---

## User Personas & Needs

### Persona 1: The Anxious Punctual Guest
- **Need**: Know ceremony won't start before they arrive
- **Solution**: Countdown timer + "Você chegou cedo - perfeito!" message

### Persona 2: The Social Photographer
- **Need**: Know when to capture photos + how to share
- **Solution**: Photo upload prompts during key events

### Persona 3: The Timeline Confused
- **Need**: Clear "what's happening NOW" indicator
- **Solution**: Bold "ACONTECENDO AGORA" with visual emphasis

### Persona 4: The Remote Viewer
- **Need**: Feel connected to live celebration
- **Solution**: Real-time timeline + live photo gallery

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal distractions
- Persistent navigation
- Simple language

✅ **Auditory Accessibility**:
- No audio-only notifications
- Visual alerts for important events

## Performance Budget

**Loading**:
- Initial load: <2 seconds (mobile 4G)
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): <2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): <100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): <0.1

**Runtime**:
- Animation framerate: 60 FPS
- Battery drain: <5% per hour
- Data usage: <500 KB page weight (excluding images)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Real-time accuracy**
- **Mitigation**: 30-second update interval + manual admin override
- **Fallback**: Static times shown if calculation fails

**Risk 2: Venue WiFi reliability**
- **Mitigation**: Offline-first PWA with cached timeline
- **Fallback**: Last successful state displayed with "Offline" indicator

**Risk 3: TV display timeout**
- **Mitigation**: Disable screen sleep via settings or keep-awake library
- **Fallback**: Manual wake-up every hour

### User Experience Risks

**Risk 1: Guest confusion with new interface**
- **Mitigation**: Pre-wedding onboarding video + simple design
- **Fallback**: QR code poster with instructions at venue

**Risk 2: Low photo upload participation**
- **Mitigation**: Clear prompts + social proof counters
- **Fallback**: Admin can upload photos on behalf of guests

**Risk 3: Accessibility barriers**
- **Mitigation**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- **Fallback**: Alternative text-only timeline view
