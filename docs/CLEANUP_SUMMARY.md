# Database Cleanup - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ All prep work complete - Ready for you to run migrations

---

## ✅ What I Did (Steps 2-5)

### 📝 Step 2: Fixed Analytics Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed `timeline_events` database query (line 102)
- ❌ Removed `TimelineEvent` interface (not needed)
- ❌ Removed `BarChart3` icon import (not used anymore)
- ❌ Removed "Eventos na Timeline" stat card from UI
- ✅ Changed `analytics.timeline` to `analytics.wedding` (cleaner naming)
- ✅ Simplified progress summary to 2 columns instead of 3

**Why:** The `timeline_events` table is deprecated (now in Sanity CMS), so analytics page shouldn't query it.

**Result:** Analytics page will work perfectly after you run migrations.

---

### 📦 Step 3: Archived Enhanced Guests Service
**File:** `src/lib/services/enhanced-guests.ts` → `src/lib/services/archive/enhanced-guests.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Created `src/lib/services/archive/` folder
- ✅ Moved 850-line enhanced-guests.ts service to archive
- ✅ Created `archive/README.md` documenting why it was archived

**Why:** This service used the old `guests` table system which you're replacing with `simple_guests` + `invitations`. No code imports it anymore.

**Result:** Service is preserved for reference (useful Brazilian wedding patterns) but won't interfere with new system.

### 🗃️ Step 4-5: Created Migration Files

**Migration 028:** `supabase/migrations/028_cleanup_old_guest_system.sql`
- Drops: `guests`, `family_groups`, `invitation_codes`, `email_logs`, `rsvp_analytics`
- Safety: Verifies `simple_guests`, `invitations`, `guest_sessions` exist first
- Impact: Removes 5 deprecated tables, frees ~2-4 MB

**Migration 029:** `supabase/migrations/029_cleanup_old_messaging_system.sql`
- Drops: `guest_messages`, `message_likes`, `moderation_queue`
- Safety: Verifies `guest_posts`, `post_reactions`, `post_comments` exist first
- Impact: Removes 3 deprecated tables, frees ~1-2 MB

**Migration 030:** `supabase/migrations/030_cleanup_old_config_and_photo_tables.sql`
- Drops: `wedding_config` (replaced by `wedding_settings`)
- Pauses: `photo_likes`, `upload_sessions` (commented out for your verification)
- Safety: Verifies `wedding_settings`, `guest_photos`, `guest_sessions` exist first
- Impact: Removes 1 config table, optionally 2 more after verification

## 🎯 What YOU Need to Do

### Option 1: Run Migrations Now (Recommended)

**Quick start:**
```bash
# 1. Backup first!
supabase db dump -f backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Run all migrations
supabase migration up

# 3. Test your app
npm run dev
# Visit: /admin/analytics, /mensagens, /convite/FAMILY001, etc.
```

**Detailed instructions:** See `docs/RUN_MIGRATIONS.md`

---

### Option 2: Run Later

The migrations are safe to run whenever you're ready. Everything will continue working with the old tables until you delete them.

**When you're ready:**
1. Read `docs/RUN_MIGRATIONS.md`
2. Backup your database
3. Run migrations one at a time
4. Test after each one

---

## 📊 Expected Outcome

**Tables that will be DELETED:**
- ❌ `guests` (old guest table)
- ❌ `family_groups` (family grouping)
- ❌ `invitation_codes` (old invitation codes)
- ❌ `email_logs` (email tracking)
- ❌ `rsvp_analytics` (analytics)
- ❌ `guest_messages` (old messages)
- ❌ `message_likes` (old likes)
- ❌ `moderation_queue` (generic queue)
- ❌ `wedding_config` (old config)

**Total:** 9 deprecated tables removed

**Tables that will STAY:**
- ✅ `simple_guests` (current guest system)
- ✅ `invitations` (personalized invitations)
- ✅ `guest_sessions` (authentication)
- ✅ `guest_photos` (photo uploads)
- ✅ `guest_posts` (social feed)
- ✅ `post_reactions` (likes/reactions)
- ✅ `post_comments` (comments)
- ✅ `pinned_posts` (live feed)
- ✅ `activity_feed` (activity tracking)
- ✅ `gifts` (gift registry)
- ✅ `payments` (payment tracking)
- ✅ `wedding_settings` (config)
- ✅ `wedding_auth_config` (auth config)

**Total:** 13 active tables (clean architecture!)

**Space freed:** ~3-8 MB

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Phase 1 (Sanity duplicates) already dropped** - You mentioned you did this already ✅

2. **Migrations are SAFE** - They verify that new tables exist before dropping old ones

3. **Local testing first** - Always run on local dev before production

4. **Backup before running** - Always create backup (command in RUN_MIGRATIONS.md)

5. **Test after each migration** - Visit key pages to make sure nothing broke

6. **Two tables need verification** - `photo_likes` and `upload_sessions` are commented out in migration 030. You can manually check if they're used and delete them later if not.
