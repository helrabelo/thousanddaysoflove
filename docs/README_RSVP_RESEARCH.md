### "I want to understand the research" (30 minutes)
1. ‚úÖ RSVP_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md (overview)
2. ‚úÖ RSVP_UX_RESEARCH_REPORT.md (deep insights)
3. Skip implementation for now

### "I want to code this weekend" (2 hours)

2. ‚úÖ RSVP_QUICK_WINS_IMPLEMENTATION.md (code)
3. ‚úÖ RSVP_VISUAL_REFERENCE.md (reference while coding)

## ‚ö° If You Only Have 10 Minutes

### Read This Section:

**The Problem:**
Your VideoHeroSection is stunning (immersive, emotional, elegant). Your RSVP is functional (search box, form, success modal). The experience quality drops dramatically between them.

**The Solution:**
Add 3 small features that take 2.5 hours total:
1. üéâ Confetti animation on "YES" confirmation
2. üì∏ Story photo with emotional text before search
3. ‚è∞ Countdown timer in success modal

**The Impact:**
Guests go from "filling out a form" to "experiencing a celebration moment." Your RSVP matches your VideoHero quality.

**The Code:**
All examples in `RSVP_QUICK_WINS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - ready to copy/paste.

**Next Step:**
Pick one feature to implement right now. Start with confetti (30 minutes, biggest wow factor).

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Hel (Developer)
1. **Start with confetti** - most satisfying to test, immediate gratification
2. **Test mobile early** - don't wait until end to check responsiveness
3. **Commit small** - one feature per commit for easy rollback
4. **Use TypeScript strict** - catch errors before users do
5. **Performance matters** - check Lighthouse scores after changes

### For Ylana (Stakeholder)
1. **Choose emotional photo** - first date, proposal, Casa HY construction
2. **Review copy tone** - should feel like you talking to guests
3. **Test on YOUR phone** - real user perspective
4. **Share with friends** - get outside feedback before launch
5. **Celebrate the work** - this site is your wedding's first impression!

### For Both
1. **Set realistic timeline** - 2.5 hours is average, might take 4 first time
2. **Test together** - catch things developer might miss
3. **Have fun with it** - this is celebrating YOUR love story
4. **Document the journey** - before/after screenshots
5. **Share the story** - how you built this together

## ‚ùì FAQ

### "Do I have to implement all 5 features?"
No! Start with 1-2 this weekend. Confetti + story photo = biggest impact. Add others later.

### "What if confetti is too much?"
Try the "sparkle burst" option - more subtle, very elegant. Or skip confetti entirely.

### "My guests aren't tech-savvy. Will this work?"
Yes! All features enhance existing functionality. Search + buttons still work the same.

### "What about older browsers?"
Features gracefully degrade. Confetti library handles browser support. No IE11, but that's fine.

### "Can I customize the copy?"
Absolutely! All text is in the code, easy to change. Make it sound like you!

### "What if I get stuck?"
- Check QUICK_WINS guide for troubleshooting
- Review Visual Reference for design questions
- Test on simpler cases first
- Commit working code before experiments

### "Should I test in production?"
NO! Test locally first (localhost:3000). Deploy only after thorough testing.

### "What about other guests seeing test RSVPs?"
Use your own name for testing, mark as "test" in admin panel, delete after.
