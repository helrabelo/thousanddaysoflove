## 🎨 Frontend Updates

### Updated Components

#### 1️⃣ `VideoHeroSection.tsx`
**What changed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded paths
poster="/images/hero-poster.jpg"
src="/images/hero-couple.jpg"

// AFTER: Dynamic from Supabase
poster={heroPosterUrl} // Loaded from site_settings
src={heroCoupleUrl}     // Loaded from site_settings
```

**Loads on mount:**
- Fetches `hero_poster_url` and `hero_couple_url` from Supabase
- Falls back to default paths if Supabase fails
- No flicker, smooth loading

#### 2️⃣ `OurFamilySection.tsx`
**What changed:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded pets array
const pets = [{name: 'Linda', ...}, ...]

// AFTER: Dynamic from Supabase
useEffect(() => {
  loadPets() // Fetches from pets table
})
```

**Features:**
- Only shows visible pets (`is_visible = true`)
- Respects `display_order`
- Auto-extracts emoji from personality
- Loading state while fetching
- Hides section if no pets
- Fallback colors per pet

## 💡 Tips

### For Hero Images
- Use high-quality photos (1920x1080)
- Compress before upload (keep under 2MB)
- Hero poster shows during video load
- Hero fallback shows for reduced motion users

### For Pet Photos
- Square format works best (600x600)
- Center the pet's face
- Good lighting is key
- Save as JPG (smaller files)

### For Timeline Photos
- Chronological order matters
- Add location & date for context
- Multiple photos per event supported
- Use display_order to control sequence

### For Gallery Photos
- Organize by category
- Add descriptive tags
- Mark best photos as "featured"
- Thumbnails auto-generated

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing?
1. Check Supabase Studio → Storage → wedding-photos
2. Verify files uploaded successfully
3. Check public URL works
4. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Migration Fails?
1. Check if tables already exist
2. Run migrations in order (001 → 016)
3. Check Supabase logs for errors
4. Contact for help with SQL

### Upload Fails?
1. File size under 5MB?
2. Valid image format (JPG/PNG)?
3. Check Supabase storage policies
4. Verify bucket exists

## 🎯 What's Still Mock?

**NOTHING!** All 41 images are now manageable through admin.

But these are still placeholders until you upload real content:
- Hero video (`/videos/hero-couple.mp4`) - You can add video upload later
- Default image paths in migration (will be replaced on first upload)
