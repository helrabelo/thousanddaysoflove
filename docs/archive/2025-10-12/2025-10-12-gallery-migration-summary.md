# Gallery Migration Summary: Supabase → Sanity CMS

**Quick Reference Guide - Phase 2 Implementation Complete**

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Sanity Schema ✅
**File**: `/src/sanity/schemas/documents/galleryImage.ts`

Complete schema with:
- Image/video asset support
- 10 categories (engagement, travel, dates, etc.)
- Tags, dates, locations, photographer
- Featured/public flags
- Display order control
- Camera metadata support
- Auto-generated blurhash, LQIP, palette

### 2. Sanity Queries ✅
**File**: `/src/sanity/queries/gallery.ts`

Service layer with:
- `SanityGalleryService` - Drop-in replacement for `SupabaseGalleryService`
- Filter by category, media type, featured status
- Search by title, description, tags, location
- Gallery statistics calculation
- Image URL builder with automatic optimization

### 3. Frontend Integration ✅
**File**: `/src/app/galeria/page.tsx`

Updated to use Sanity:
- Imports `SanityGalleryService` instead of `SupabaseGalleryService`
- Zero UI changes - maintains exact user experience
- All components still work (MasonryGallery, VideoGallery, MediaLightbox)

### 4. Migration Script ✅
**File**: `/scripts/migrate-gallery-to-sanity.ts`

Automated migration tool:
- Reads exported Supabase data
- Uploads images to Sanity
- Creates gallery documents with metadata
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Rate limiting for API

### 5. Documentation ✅
**File**: `/GALLERY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

Comprehensive guide with:
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Three admin interface options
- Testing checklist
- Rollback plan
- Performance benchmarks
- Cost analysis

## How to Use

### For Development (Testing with Empty Sanity)

```bash
# 1. Start dev server with Sanity Studio
npm run dev

# 2. Open Sanity Studio
open http://localhost:3000/studio

# 3. Create test gallery images
# - Click "Gallery Images" → "Create new"
# - Upload image, fill fields, publish
# - Repeat for a few images

# 4. View on gallery page
open http://localhost:3000/galeria
```

### For Production (Full Migration)

```bash
# 1. Export from Supabase
# Visit /admin/galeria → Export Gallery Data
# Saves: galeria-completa-YYYY-MM-DD.json

# 2. Download images from Supabase Storage
# Create: ./gallery-migration/
#   - galeria-completa.json
#   - images/ (all downloaded images)

# 3. Run migration script
npm install @sanity/client dotenv
npx tsx scripts/migrate-gallery-to-sanity.ts

# 4. Verify in Sanity Studio
open http://localhost:3000/studio

# 5. Test gallery page
open http://localhost:3000/galeria
```
