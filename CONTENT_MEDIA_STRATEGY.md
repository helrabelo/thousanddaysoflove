# Content & Media Strategy: Thousand Days of Love

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Transform the wedding website from a text-heavy, template-like experience into a visually rich, cinematic storytelling journey that authentically captures Hel & Ylana's 1000-day love story through strategic use of personal videos and photos.

**Narrative Arc**: The website tells a three-act story:
- **Act I (Homepage)**: First impression - "This is US" - Immediate emotional connection through authentic visuals
- **Act II (Story/Gallery)**: The journey - 1000 days of growth, from first "oi" to family of 6
- **Act III (Practical Pages)**: The celebration - Invitation to join our milestone moment

**Approach**: DTF-inspired cinematic storytelling with full-bleed heroes, intentional overlays, and authentic moments over polished perfection. Every visual serves the narrative: two introverted tech-savvy people who found each other, built a home, and now want 60 close people to witness their commitment.

### Storytelling Approach Decisions

**Perspective: First Person Plural ("A gente")**

- Direct address to guests
- Inclusive language
- Establishes intimacy with reader

**Tone Balance: 70% Romantic / 30% Humorous**
- Predominantly romantic storytelling
- Strategic humor reveals personality
- Examples:
  - Romantic: "O que a gente tem entre a gente √© muito maior..."
  - Humor: "Ylana n√£o deu muita escolha pro Hel" (Cacao)
  - Humor: "60 pessoas. Pra quem √© introvertido, isso √© muita gente."

**Literalness: Mostly Literal with Metaphorical Accents**
- Tell story straightforwardly
- Use metaphors for emotional beats
- Examples:
  - Literal: "1000 dias desde aquele 6 de janeiro de 2023"
  - Metaphor: "Do Tinder ao WhatsApp" (journey of deepening connection)

**Style: Documentary with Editorial Flourishes**
- Document real story chronologically
- Add editorial perspective on key moments
- Timeline is documentary
- Emotional context is editorial
- Example: "Na hora eu j√° sabia: '√© ela'" - editorial insight on documentary moment

- Negative space for emotional moments
- Symmetry for pet portraits (they're the royalty)
- Break rules for authenticity

**Lighting Preferences:**
- Natural window light (home photos)
- Golden hour (exterior/venue shots)
- Soft overcast (avoid harsh shadows)
- Avoid: Flash photography, artificial harsh light

**Emotional Direction:**
**For Couple Photos:**
- Genuine laughter > forced smiles
- Looking at each other > camera
- Natural touch (holding hands, arm around)
- Comfortable clothing
- Home setting preferred

**For Pet Photos:**

- Linda: Regal, composed
- Cacao: Energetic, vocal
- Olivia: Calm, gentle
- Oliver: Playful, dynamic

**For Venue Photos:**
- Empty space (before wedding)
- Architectural beauty highlighted
- Art gallery aesthetic prominent

## 6. ALTERNATIVE CONTENT STRATEGIES

### Scenario A: No Suitable Couple Videos

**Alternative 1: Ken Burns Effect Photo Slideshow**
```
Implementation:
- Take 5-10 best couple photos
- Apply slow zoom/pan (Ken Burns effect)
- 3-second per photo
- Cross-fade transitions
- Background music (licensed instrumental)
- Total duration: 15-30 seconds
- Export as video file

Tools:
- iMovie (Mac)
- Windows Photos (PC)
- Online: Animoto, Adobe Express

Pros: Achieves motion without filming
Cons: Less dynamic than real video
```

**Alternative 2: Location Video with Text Overlay**
```
Implementation:
- Film apartment walkthrough (empty or with pets)
- Film venue exterior/interior
- Add text overlays with love story quotes
- Cinematic slow pans
- Voiceover option (read their story)

Example:
[Video: Apartment living room pan]
Text: "Esse apartamento que o Hel passava de bicicleta..."
[Video: Kitchen where they cook]
Text: "A gente √© daqueles que prefere ficar em casa..."

Pros: Still shows their spaces authentically
Cons: Less personal without them in frame
```

**Alternative 3: Static Hero with Parallax Scroll**
```
Implementation:
- Use high-res couple photo
- Apply parallax effect (background moves slower)
- Add subtle CSS animations (fade in, scale)
- Text overlay animates in stages
- Scroll indicator pulses

Pros: Works with one great photo
Cons: No motion in hero itself
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with Alternative 3, upgrade to video later**

---

### Scenario B: Limited Timeline Photos

**Alternative 1: Recreate Symbolic Moments**
```
Examples:
- Can't find first date photo ‚Üí Photo at Casa Fontana now
- No sick day photo ‚Üí Recreate with tea/medicine props
- Missing travel photos ‚Üí Use location stock photos with personal captions

Implementation:
- Be honest about recreation
- Caption: "Representa√ß√£o de..." or "Lembran√ßa de..."
- Focus on emotion over literal accuracy
- Use props/locations that trigger memories

Pros: Can complete timeline visually
Cons: Less authentic than originals
```

**Alternative 2: Use Symbolic Imagery**
```
Examples:
Instead of actual photos:
- WhatsApp interface screenshot (Day 1)
- Calendar graphic (anniversary dates)
- Map pins (travel locations)
- Illustration of apartment building
- Dog silhouettes ‚Üí actual pet photos

Implementation:
- Mix symbolic graphics with real photos
- Maintains timeline completeness
- Icons/illustrations for moments without photos
- Real photos for moments you have them

Pros: Tells complete story despite gaps
Cons: Less personal impact
```

**Alternative 3: Text-Heavy Timeline Cards**
```
Implementation:
- Timeline events that lack photos become text cards
- Beautiful typography on solid backgrounds
- Botanical decorations (matching site theme)
- Focus on storytelling through words
- Photos used only where available

Example Card:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ   [Botanical corner accent]    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   6 de Janeiro de 2023         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   O Primeiro "Oi"              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   "Aquele primeiro 'oi' meio   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   sem gra√ßa no WhatsApp. A     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   gente quase nem respondeu."  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   [Botanical corner accent]    ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

Pros: Maintains elegant design, tells story
Cons: Less visually engaging
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Combination approach**
- Use real photos where available (priority)
- Symbolic imagery for 3-4 missing moments
- Text-only cards for 1-2 minor events
- Result: Visually rich despite gaps

---

### Scenario C: No Proposal Photos/Video

**Alternative 1: Location Reenactment**
```
Implementation:

- Golden hour photography
- Focus on their expressions
- Caption: "Voltando ao lugar onde..."

```
Implementation:

Pros: Still captures emotional high
Cons: Missing the actual moment
```

**Alternative 3: Symbolic Representation**
```
Implementation:
- Beautiful Icara√≠ location photo (empty)

- Date and quote overlaid
- Artistic rather than documentary

Example:
[Background: Icara√≠ waterfront, sunset]
Overlay: "Aqui, neste lugar, em [DATE]
         ele perguntou. Ela disse sim.
         1000 dias se tornaram para sempre."

Pros: Still tells the story beautifully

## 10. FINAL CONTENT STRATEGY STATEMENT

### Our Commitment to Authentic Visual Storytelling

This website will succeed not because it has the most photos, the longest videos, or the fanciest effects. It will succeed because **every visual serves the story of Hel & Ylana's authentic journey**.

**We prioritize:**
1. **Authenticity over perfection** - Real moments beat posed ones
2. **Story over decoration** - Every image advances the narrative
3. **Intimacy over spectacle** - 60 people, not 600, and visuals reflect that
4. **Personality over templates** - "Caseiros e introvertidos" shown, not just told
5. **Quality over quantity** - 200 great photos beat 1000 mediocre ones

**We will NOT:**
- Use stock photos (everything is real)
- Over-polish (life is messy, especially with 4 dogs)
- Create false narratives (story is already great)
- Sacrifice load speed for excessive visuals
- Forget mobile users (most guests browse on phones)

**Success looks like:**
- Guests arrive at wedding feeling they already know the couple
- References to website stories during celebration
- Pets treated like celebrities (because guests "met" them)
- 85%+ RSVP rate (story motivated action)
- Comments: "This is the best wedding website I've ever seen, felt so personal"

**The ultimate test:**
If a guest spends 10 minutes on this website, do they understand:
‚úì Who Hel & Ylana are (introverted, authentic, tech-savvy foodies)
‚úì How they got here (1000 days from WhatsApp "oi" to wedding)
‚úì Why this matters (depth over spectacle, real love story)
‚úì What they're celebrating (commitment, family of 6, dream realized)
‚úì How to join them (Casa HY, Nov 20, 60 people, be part of their story)

If yes, we succeeded.
