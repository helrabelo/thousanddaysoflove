## üö¶ Critical Next Steps (According to Roadmap)

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE: Complete Week 2 (40% remaining)

**Priority 1: Content Upload** (1-2 hours)
Must run migration and upload through new admin system:

1. **Run Database Migration** (5 min)
   ```
   Migration: supabase/migrations/016_hero_and_pets_management.sql
   Action: Open Supabase Studio ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí Run migration
   Result: Enables all image admin pages
   ```

2. **Upload Hero Content** (20 min)
   ```
   Where: /admin/hero-images
   What: 2 images (hero poster 1920x1080, hero fallback 1920x1080)
   Result: Homepage video hero complete
   ```

3. **Upload Pet Portraits** (30 min)
   ```
   Where: /admin/pets
   What: 4 photos (Linda, Cacao, Olivia, Oliver - 600x600 each)
   Original Plan: "Pet Portrait Photo Session (2-3 hours)"
   Result: Pet gallery complete with real photos
   ```

**Priority 2: Missing Week 2 Features** (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Redesign Event Details section (countdown timer, 3-column grid)
- [ ] Build Story Preview Split Section
- [ ] Select Timeline Preview Photos (4-5 photos)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness final check
- [ ] Performance optimization

---

### üü° THEN: Start Week 3 (Story & Gallery Depth)

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Select 8-10 timeline moment photos
- [ ] Transform /historia with full-bleed moments
- [ ] Curate 200-250 gallery photos
- [ ] Add gallery year transitions

**Estimated**: 25-30 hours

---

### üü¢ FINALLY: Week 4 (Polish & Launch)

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Supporting page heroes
- [ ] Complete testing
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Production launch

**Estimated**: 20-25 hours

---

## üìä What Does This Mean?

### The Good News üéâ
1. **Ahead on code**: Week 2 features are built
2. **Bonus systems**: Image CMS wasn't planned but exists
3. **Strong foundation**: Week 1 100% complete
4. **Can launch early**: With just content uploads

### The Content Blocker üî¥
**Original roadmap assumption**: Content gathering runs parallel to development

**Reality**: Development done, but **no real photos uploaded yet**

**Impact**:
- Week 2 code: ‚úÖ Done
- Week 2 content: ‚è≥ Not done
- Week 3: ‚è≥ Can't start (needs real photos)

### The Path Forward üöÄ

**Option A: Quick Content Sprint** (2-3 hours)
1. Run migration (5 min)
2. Upload hero + pets (1 hour)
3. Test with real content (30 min)
4. Complete remaining Week 2 features (1 hour)
**Result**: Week 2 100% complete today

**Option B: Full Content Upload** (4-6 hours)
1. Run migration (5 min)
2. Upload ALL images via admin (3 hours):
   - Hero (2 images)
   - Pets (4 images)
   - Timeline (15 images)
   - Gallery (8+ images)
3. Complete Week 2 features (2 hours)
**Result**: Week 2 complete + Week 3 unblocked

**Option C: Just Launch** (30 min)
1. Run migration (5 min)
2. Deploy with mock content (25 min)
3. Upload real content post-launch
**Result**: Live site, iterate later

---

## üéØ Recommendation

**Based on IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md priorities:**

### Path: Option A (Quick Content Sprint)

**Why**:
1. Roadmap says Week 2 must complete before Week 3
2. Only 40% of Week 2 left (content uploads)
3. You have a CMS now (easier than original plan)
4. 2-3 hours gets Week 2 to 100%

**Today's Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Run migration (5 min) - **DO THIS FIRST**
2. ‚úÖ Upload hero images (15 min)
3. ‚úÖ Upload pet photos (30 min)
4. ‚úÖ Test homepage with real content (15 min)
5. ‚úÖ Complete Event Details redesign (1 hour)
6. ‚úÖ Build Story Preview section (1 hour)

**Result**: Week 2 fully complete, ready for Week 3 Monday!

---

## üìù Key Insight

**Original Roadmap**: "Content gathering runs parallel to development"
**What Happened**: Development went FAST, content gathering lagged

**Solution**: Catch up on content now (much easier with new CMS!)

**Roadmap Status**:
- Code-wise: Ahead of Week 2
- Content-wise: Behind Week 2
- Next: Complete Week 2 content, then proceed to Week 3

---

## üöÄ Bottom Line

**You're NOT behind the roadmap** - you're actually AHEAD on code!

**The blocker**: Just need to upload real photos through the beautiful admin system you now have.

**Time to Week 2 complete**: 2-3 hours (content upload + finishing touches)
**Time to Week 3 start**: Ready after Week 2 content done
**Time to launch**: Could launch anytime (roadmap says Week 4, but Week 2 might be enough)

**Next command**: Run that migration, then upload some photos! üéØ
