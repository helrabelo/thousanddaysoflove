# Phase 2: Gallery Integration - COMPLETE âœ…

## Session Summary
Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the guest photo system, integrating approved guest-uploaded photos into the main gallery with elegant UI, phase filtering, and guest attribution.

## What Was Completed

### 1. SupabaseGalleryService (src/lib/supabase/gallery.ts) âœ…
Created service layer to fetch approved guest photos from Supabase:
- `getApprovedGuestPhotos()`: Fetch all approved photos with optional phase/type filters
- `getApprovedPhotosByPhase()`: Group approved photos by phase (before/during/after)
- `getGuestPhotoStats()`: Get statistics (total, approved, counts per phase)
- `guestPhotoToMediaItem()`: Convert GuestPhoto to MediaItem format
- Type-safe implementation with proper error handling

### 2. Gallery Page Integration (src/app/galeria/page.tsx) âœ…
Updated gallery page to merge both photo sources:
- Fetch Sanity CMS photos (existing)
- Fetch approved guest photos (new)
- Merge both sources into single MediaItem array
- Pass to GalleryClient component for main gallery display
- Conditionally render GuestPhotosSection when guest photos exist

### 3. GuestPhotosSection Component (src/components/gallery/GuestPhotosSection.tsx) âœ…
Created dedicated guest photos section with:
- **Phase Filtering Tabs**: All/Before/During/After tabs with photo counts
- **Guest Attribution**: Avatar circle with initials, name, upload date
- **Visual Badges**: Phase badges (Antes/Durante/Depois) + "Convidado" badge
- **Responsive Grid**: 1-4 columns responsive layout
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth hover effects and reveal animations
- **Wedding Aesthetic**: Elegant design matching site's Playfair/Crimson fonts
- **Empty States**: Graceful handling when no photos in selected phase

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- âœ… Approved guest photos appear in main gallery
- âœ… Dedicated "Fotos dos Convidados" section with phase tabs
- âœ… Guest name attribution with avatar display
- âœ… Photo counts per phase in real-time
- âœ… Phase filtering (all/before/during/after)
- âœ… Video support (displays video player for guest videos)
- âœ… Hover overlays with title/caption
- âœ… Mobile-first responsive design
- âœ… Elegant wedding invitation aesthetic

## Technical Highlights

### Data Flow
```
Supabase guest_photos table
â†“
SupabaseGalleryService.getApprovedGuestPhotos()
â†“
Convert to MediaItem format
â†“
Merge with Sanity CMS photos
â†“
Display in GalleryClient (main gallery)
â†“
Display in GuestPhotosSection (dedicated section)
```

### Type Safety
- Used type assertions (`as any`) for `guest_photos` table queries
- Reason: Table not in generated TypeScript types yet
- Future: Run `npm run db:generate` when using cloud Supabase

### Performance Optimizations
- Server-side rendering for gallery data
- Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Conditional rendering (only show section if photos exist)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/lib/supabase/gallery.ts` - Guest photo service layer (209 lines)
2. `src/components/gallery/GuestPhotosSection.tsx` - Guest photos UI (397 lines)
3. `PHASE_2_GALLERY_COMPLETE.md` - This completion summary

### Modified Files
1. `src/app/galeria/page.tsx` - Integrated guest photos with Sanity photos
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with Phase 2 completion documentation

## Testing Status

### Build Status âœ…
- Production build successful
- No TypeScript errors (type assertions working)
- All pages compile correctly

### Manual Testing Needed
**Test Plan:**
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/galeria
2. Verify Sanity CMS photos display (existing)
3. Scroll to "Fotos dos Convidados" section
4. Test phase tabs (All/Antes/Durante/Depois)
5. Verify guest attribution displays correctly
6. Test hover effects on photo cards
7. Check mobile responsive design
8. Verify empty states if no photos in phase

### Expected Behavior
- Main gallery shows both Sanity + guest photos merged
- Guest photos section appears only if approved photos exist
- Phase tabs show correct photo counts
- Guest names and dates display on photo cards
- Smooth animations and elegant design throughout

## Commits Made
1. **51e3a80**: `feat: implement Phase 2 gallery integration with guest photos`
