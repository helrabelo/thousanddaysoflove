- **Problem**: Development server was failing with critical ECMAScript error "You're importing a component that needs 'next/headers'. That only works in a Server Component" caused by Supabase server.ts file containing cookies import being used in client components, preventing RSVP page functionality and blocking development workflow
- **Process**: Identified root cause as server.ts file importing 'next/headers' cookies function while being imported by client-side GuestService in RSVP forms, completely recreated server.ts file removing all server-only dependencies (cookies, @supabase/ssr), simplified to basic @supabase/supabase-js client creation for API routes only, cleared Next.js cache (.next directory) to ensure clean compilation, restarted development server with fresh build
- **Result**: DEVELOPMENT SERVER RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY - Eliminated ECMAScript import error completely, both homepage (/) and RSVP page (/rsvp) returning HTTP 200 status, clean development server logs with no compilation errors, proper client/server component separation maintained, wedding website fully functional for continued development and testing; server.ts now contains only client-compatible Supabase client creation without server-only dependencies
