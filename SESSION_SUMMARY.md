# Development Session Summary - Oct 11, 2025

## 🎉 COMPLETE: Week 1 IA Transformation + VideoHero Implementation

### What We Accomplished

#### ✅ Week 1: Information Architecture (8→6 pages)
1. **Removed duplicate content:**
   - AboutUsSection from `/historia`
   - StoryTimeline from `/galeria`
   - Entire `/convite` page (redundant)

2. **Consolidated pages:**
   - Merged `/local` + `/informacoes` → `/detalhes`
   - Updated navigation to reflect 6-page structure

3. **Enhanced RSVP flow:**
   - Added beautiful success modal with next-step guidance
   - Attending guests: 4-step guide (calendar, details, gifts, story)
   - Non-attending: graceful alternative engagement options

#### ✅ VideoHero Implementation with Mock Content
1. **Created DTF-inspired hero component:**
   - Full-viewport immersive video background
   - Dark gradient overlay for text readability
   - Monogram, names, tagline, date, CTAs
   - Scroll indicator with bounce animation
   - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

2. **Added placeholder content:**
   - `public/videos/hero-couple.mp4` (10-second placeholder)
   - `public/images/hero-poster.jpg` (loading state)
   - `public/images/hero-couple.jpg` (fallback for reduced motion)

3. **Updated homepage:**
   - Imported and activated `VideoHeroSection`
   - Ready for you to see the transformation!

## 📝 Notes & Tips

### Performance
- Placeholder video is only 11KB (super small)
- Your real video should be under 5MB
- Use FFmpeg commands in HERO_SETUP_GUIDE.md

### Design Decisions
- VideoHero for maximum emotional impact (recommended)
- ImageHero if you have stunning photo but no video
- Both are fully responsive and accessible

### Browser Compatibility
- Video autoplays on all modern browsers
- Fallback to image if autoplay blocked
- Respects user's motion preferences

### Mobile Optimization
- Video uses poster image during load
- Proper touch targets (44px minimum)
- Safe area insets for notched phones
