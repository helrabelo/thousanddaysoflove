## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Essential Pre-Launch
These should be completed before wedding day:

#### 1. **Test Guest Photo Flow End-to-End** (30 min)
- [ ] Test guest upload at `/dia-1000/login`
- [ ] Upload test photos in all phases (before/during/after)
- [ ] Test admin moderation at `/admin/photos`
- [ ] Verify approved photos appear in `/galeria`
- [ ] Test phase filtering tabs
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

#### 2. **Generate Supabase TypeScript Types** (10 min)
Current workaround uses type assertions for `guest_photos` table.
```bash
# Connect to production Supabase
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id uottcbjzpiudgmqzhuii > src/types/supabase.ts
```
This will:
- Remove type assertion workarounds
- Add proper types for `guest_photos`, `simple_guests`, `guest_sessions`
- Improve type safety across admin and gallery code

#### 3. **Deploy to Vercel** (if not already deployed)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- [ ] Add environment variables (Supabase, Sanity, SendGrid, Mercado Pago)
- [ ] Test production build
- [ ] Configure custom domain: `thousandaysof.love`

#### 4. **Test RSVP & Payment Flows**
- [ ] Test RSVP submission
- [ ] Test PIX payment generation
- [ ] Verify email notifications work (SendGrid)
- [ ] Check admin analytics dashboard

### Priority 2: Nice-to-Have Enhancements

#### 5. **Gallery Multi-Media Carousel** (1-2 hours)
**Status**: Planned but not started
**Documentation**: See `NEXT_SESSION_GALLERY_CAROUSEL.md`

Refactor gallery to support multiple images/videos per album:
- Update Sanity schema to support media arrays
- Add badge indicators for multi-media items
- Open MediaCarousel in lightbox when clicked

**When to do**: After wedding if you want to create photo albums

#### 6. **Guest Photo Enhancements** (Optional)
- [ ] Add lightbox support for guest photos (click to expand)
- [ ] Add photo download functionality
- [ ] Add social sharing buttons
- [ ] Photo likes/reactions from other guests
- [ ] Comment system on guest photos

#### 7. **Mobile App (PWA)**
- [ ] Configure PWA manifest
- [ ] Add offline support
- [ ] Enable "Add to Home Screen"
- [ ] Push notifications for RSVP reminders

### Priority 3: Post-Wedding

#### 8. **Thank You Section**
After the wedding:
- [ ] Upload professional photos to Sanity
- [ ] Create "Thank You" page
- [ ] Display all guest photos in final gallery
- [ ] Generate wedding recap video/slideshow

#### 9. **Analytics & Insights**
- [ ] Review guest engagement metrics
- [ ] Analyze photo upload statistics
- [ ] Track RSVP conversion rates
- [ ] Payment/gift statistics

## ðŸ“ž Support & Questions

### Common Issues

**Q: Guest photos not appearing in gallery?**
- Check photo moderation status at `/admin/photos`
- Ensure photos are "approved" (not pending/rejected)
- Verify `SupabaseGalleryService` is fetching correctly

**Q: TypeScript errors about guest_photos?**
- Expected until types are regenerated
- Type assertions (`as any`) are safe workarounds
- Run type generation command when possible

**Q: Admin login not working?**
- Password: `HelYlana1000Dias!` (from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var)
- Check `.env.local` file exists
- Verify cookie-based auth session

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (port 3000)
npm run build            # Test production build
npm run type-check       # Check TypeScript errors

# Database
npm run supabase:studio  # Open Supabase admin (if local)

# Deployment
vercel                   # Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod            # Deploy to production

# Type generation (when available)
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id uottcbjzpiudgmqzhuii > src/types/supabase.ts
```
