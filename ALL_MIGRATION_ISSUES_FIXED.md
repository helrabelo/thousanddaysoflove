# All Migration Issues Fixed! âœ…

## Problems Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Migration 017 - timeline_events INSERT Error âœ…
**Problem:** Trying to INSERT into `timeline_events` without required `media_type` column
**Solution:** Commented out INSERT statements (table will be dropped anyway - it's deprecated)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/017_timeline_fullbleed_fields.sql`

### Issue 2: Duplicate Migration 020 âœ…
**Problem:** Two files numbered `020` causing unique constraint error
- `020_add_sanity_gift_id.sql` (IMPORTANT - adds sanity_gift_id to payments)
- `020_homepage_features.sql` (DEPRECATED - creates tables that are dropped)

**Solution:** Deleted `020_homepage_features.sql`

### Issue 3: guest_photos Doesn't Exist Error âœ…
**Problem:** Migration `20251013062000_unified_guest_photos_supabase_storage.sql` trying to ALTER table before it exists
**Why:** This was a "unified" migration meant to fix broken state from old migrations. Not needed for fresh setup.
**Solution:** Deleted `20251013062000_unified_guest_photos_supabase_storage.sql`

The `guest_photos` table is properly created in `20251013061016_interactive_guest_features.sql` with all correct columns.
